# Authenticating requests

To authenticate requests, include a **`Authorization`** header with the value **`"Bearer {YOUR_AUTH_KEY}"`**.

All authenticated endpoints are marked with a `requires authentication` badge in the documentation below.

You can retrieve your token by calling login api for admin & users (customer)
